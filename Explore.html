        <h2>Our School</h2>
        <p>The Prize pre-School was established in 2013, and the Prize School followed in 2014.<br> Among its founders are a group of academic, social and educational leaders. The purpose was to create a distinguished <br>educational modelâ€”one that focuses on building future leaders by helping them develop social skills and<br> sensitize them to become good citizens. The Prize School also recognizes that children, if educated as such from an early age, can master logical and <br>creative thinking that enable them to effectively solve problems, thereby broadening their horizons to acquire knowledge <br>and lead fulfilling lives in future.
